# **Deep Learning with PyTorch : Neural Style Transfer**

## **About The Project**

I used the PyTorch Library, prebuild model to make a Neural Style Transfer.
<br>
I used Google Colab to run the code in the GPU at the server at runtime.
<br>
The model extracts the features from the content image and try to fit the style image into the extracted features.
## **Visual Representation!**

**Below, The First Image is The Content Image and Second Image is The Style Image.**

**Below, The First Image is The Image Generated By The model and second Image is The content Image.**

## **Control Intensity!**

**Below are Some Images with Different Intensity, We Can Control The intensity by Changing The Values of The Epochs!**
